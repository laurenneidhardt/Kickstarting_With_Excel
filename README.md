### Challenges and Difficulties encountered:My main issues were getting the forumlas to work correctly

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 1. Campaigns are less successful at the end/beginning of the year. Possibly due to the holidays and the amount of free income people have 2.Spring/Summer are the best times to run a fundraising campaign

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? That the lower the goal, the more successful the campaign

- What are some limitations of this dataset? Since there are far more total projects with lower goals, the use of the percentage successful vs failed doesn't give an accurate picture of the data. Example, 6 total projects have a goal of $35000-$39000, 4 being successful, making it 67%. For projects with a goal of less than $1000, there are 796 total, 506 being successful at 64%. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? It would be more beneficial to chart the data by total projects and total success so that the user would get a clear understanding that lower goals mean more success. I think a stacked bar graph would communicate this clearly.
